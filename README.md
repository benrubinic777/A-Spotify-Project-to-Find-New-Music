# Spotify_Analysis
For this project, the goal was to see if I could create a model that could distinguish between the music I like and music I do not like. And if I could find a model that worked, would it help me find music from lesser-known artists that I may normally never come across? Luckily, Spotify makes this process easy with some help from the Spotipy library. The project follows through the full life cycle of a typical data science project and concludes with a final model that has helped me find new songs I enjoy without making me listen to many songs I likely would not like. These selections are passed back to Spotify in the form of a playlist which is now part of my library. As I get more song recommendations, I can hopefully continue to narrow down what makes a song "click" for me.

Most of the libraries are standard, but a few will likely need to be downloaded

Spotipy, the library used to work with the Spotify API, can be downloaded from \nhttps://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/#api-reference
