# Spotify_Analysis
For this project, the goal was to see if I could create a model that could distinguish between the music I like and music I do not like. And if I could find a model that worked, would it help me find music from lesser-known artists that I may normally never come across? Luckily, Spotify makes this process easy with some help from the Spotipy library. The project follows through the full life cycle of a typical data science project and concludes with a final model that has helped me find new songs I enjoy without making me listen to many songs I likely would not like. These selections are passed back to Spotify in the form of a playlist which is now part of my library. As I get more song recommendations, I can hopefully continue to narrow down what makes a song "click" for me.

Most of the libraries are standard, but a few will likely need to be downloaded

Spotipy, the library used to work with the Spotify API, can be downloaded from: 
https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/#api-reference

or by using 
pip install spotipy

To view the Plotly graphics, you may need to view the HTML versions of the code which is on my LinkedIn. Plotly images tend to not show up on Github. By creating static images, I should be able to get around this problem.
